      //I created this conditional at first because I realized this API can be very finicky with it's spellings. When 'one piece' is searched it brings up the rating for one of the 'OVA' episodes that doesn't have a rating at all. A solution that was proposed was to loop through the the different series data to hopefully get a more accurate score. Due to the nature of the data  presented I would have to do this for several titles especially some of the newer titles like 'demon slayer'. In the future I hope to find a more concise api to work with.
