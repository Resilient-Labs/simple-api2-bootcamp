  <h1>You're a Magical Girl!</h1>
  <p>The Clow Cards are fifty-three magical, mystical cards used in the manga
    and anime series Cardcaptor Sakura. The cards can only be controlled
    under your command if you become its owner. In order to do that, you must
    sign your name at the bottom of the card. It belongs to whoever binds its power: the one who defeated it.
