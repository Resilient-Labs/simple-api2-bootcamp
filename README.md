## How It's Made

This is a simple API application that starts off by storing the user inputs (text and lanuage) as variables, then those variables are entered as parameter values to send a request to the Fun Translations API. The data relayed back after the successfull fetch request is displayed using the innerHTML element property.

## What I Learned
Because I wanted the user to be able to input data in a paragraph format, I learned about the textarea tag. It was a more syntactically correct and cleaner approach of displaying the user input, compared to just a typical single-lined input box.
