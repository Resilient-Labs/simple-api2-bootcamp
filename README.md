# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 2

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

Is it Mid? is an API based application that allows the user to type in the name of any anime and returns back the score and a brief description. Depending on the number of that score it is given an addtional ranking of being 'Mid'.

what is 'Mid'? :
 "mid" is used to describe something or someone as below average or low quality. It can be used as an insult or to oppose the opinion of another. In other words, "mid" can be used as a replacement for "boring," "not good," "mediocre," "low quality," among others.


Lessons Learned: The api that I chose has a few gaps in the data set that causes some 'false-positives' on ratings. One in particular is the anime 'One Piece' which the database of the API does not hold the current anime only OVAs, Movies, and Specials which have wildly different scores. In the future I would love to update this app with an API that has a more fleshed out database
