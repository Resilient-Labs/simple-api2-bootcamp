<b>Tech Used</b>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

<b>What I Learned</b>: Never in a million years did I think that I would be able to recreate a dictionary app! APIs continue to impress me. I also loved my CSS on this project. It is a simple design but I learned how to play around with the border-radius property and it was very exciting to use.
