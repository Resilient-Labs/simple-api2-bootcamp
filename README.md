# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 2

In this project I created a simple app that displays data returned from an Cardcaptor Sakura API. I loved watching this Anime growing up so I used this API to display the meaning, and translations of all the clow cards she collects.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I used the Cardcaptor Sakura API to diplay the card image, the name, translation, and Kanji as well. I was able to use loops and appendchild to add the data to display in the DOM. The CSS is super simple, using some brigt colors from the show.

## Lessons Learned:

It was hard to find an API that worked, but when I finally found this one I was so excited to work with this. I used some JavaScript patterns from other projects to access the data.
