# About this project
This project uses an API to convert to over 170 currencies.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Lessons Learned:
I learned the quirks of dealing with APIs. This API documentation was difficult for me to read and I ended up choosing an API that didn't have all the information I needed so I had to use 2 and make them work together. I learned how to pass information from one function into the next to make everything work together.
