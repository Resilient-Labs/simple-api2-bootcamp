# Discography Generator
This was my first time searching for an API on my own to use without a clear mission on what API to use.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

Really just used some basic HTML & CSS along with the ES6 I used after fetching the data from NASA.

## Optimizations
There's plenty that can be done here. Primarily, I want to change hte code so that the list resets when you click the button again. I'd also like to be able to remove single albums on click. Really, the only further optimization code wise would be adding other APIs to have more functionality by doing things like generating track details per album or being able to store information in a separate list or play actual songs from clicked albums.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned it can be frustratingly difficult to just choose an API and find one that works the way you need it to, or that doesn't require a lengthy authentication process, or that is structured in a way that you can currently understand and modify.
