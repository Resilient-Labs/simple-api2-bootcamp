# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 2

### This simple API project has the user click a button to present a dad joke to them.

I used HTML, CSS, the API documentation online, and JavaScript to code this project

### Lessons Learned:

- With the help of RC mentors I got a better understanding of headers since this API required header values to send an output to me. It was very interesting to learn more about this concept.
