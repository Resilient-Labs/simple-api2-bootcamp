### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To create this app the first major step I took was to research a working API to generate the pictures of kittens . After I found one I created a fetch within JavaScript. Next I created varibles to display the information given from the fetched API in the dom.

### Lessons Learned:
The major lesson I learned from this project was how to properly fetch an API.
