# My To do list
This project is a simple Pokemon API. I was able to utilize the names of any Pokemon, so when you input a name it will give you the move list of the Pokemon that you've searched for.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a wireframe for the Pokemon API with an input and a button. I used CSS to margin the input and button to center them. Next I centered the list of moves and removed the list style. Lastly I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the button and the input to request for the Pokemon that is being searched for, and finally fetches the move list from the API.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can use JavaScript to create elements (such as a section) and then you can append a list into the element.
