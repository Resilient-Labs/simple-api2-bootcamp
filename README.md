## Design and Development:
**Tech Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, JSON: 
Displaying a quote of the day by using today's current day as inpout value to generate quote from Quotes on Design's API. 

## Reflections:
Simple and fun to make. I can see the allure of apps that generate one quote per day- easy to build and users don't get overloaded with information
