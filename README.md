## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The main interface provides an button where users can clixk to see the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin or Ethereum) and the currency (Euros or Dollars).

The JavaScript then connects to a crypto API to fetch the latest prices. Upon receiving the data, the JavaScript dynamically updates the interface to display the required information.

The CSS was used to give the site a modern and clean design. 

## Optimizations:
To ensure faster load times and efficient performance:
- Assets like images and CSS files were minimized.
- Refactored the JavaScript code to reduce redundancy and improve execution time.

## Lessons Learned:
Throughout the development of this project, I had numerous moments of learning:
- Realized the importance of error handling, especially when dealing with third-party APIs.
- Understood the nuances of programming in JavaScript.
