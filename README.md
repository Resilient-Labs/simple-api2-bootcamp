# The Metropolitan Museum of Art API

<a href="https://kellychhe-simple-met-api.netlify.app/">This website</a> allows the user to select a department at the Met and the API will randomly display a work of art from that department. It shows a picture of the art, the artist, the start and end of its creation, the period the art is from, and what gallery it could be found in.

## Languages Used
This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

I have been to the Met countless times since childhood and I always find something new each time I go. For this project I fetched a list of all of the art works for each department. I used Math.random() to pick an art ID from the collection so I could display some of its information on the DOM. The user could use the gallery info to find where in the Met the item is displayed (if it is currently displayed).

## Lessons Learned

The Met collection is so expansive that reading the documentation took a very long time and it was hard to figure out what was useful for my project and what wasn't.
