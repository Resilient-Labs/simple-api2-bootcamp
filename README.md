# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 2

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

This web app uses a gif API to return exactly what you asked for: the Greatest of All Time.  At the click of a button, an audio player loaded with Nicki Minaj's "Barbie Goin Bad" comes up, accompanied by a quote from the track and a wall of Nicki Minaj gifs.
