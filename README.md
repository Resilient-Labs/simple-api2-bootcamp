This api will generate a random activity for the user to do when bored depending on the general type they enter.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JS, boredapi

In HTML, I created a form with an input and submit button. When the user inputs an activity type and clicks on the button, a function will run. When it runs, the activity type the user inputs will be passed through the boredapi, and the api will generate a random activity based on that type. I display the random activity into the DOM.

## Lessons Learned

Drop down menus are a pain to deal with.
