How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

Optimizations
(optional)
I would like to go back and add css to this site as well as some user functionality.

Lessons Learned:
Heroku apis load SO slow and while creating this site I thought it wasn't working or that there was an issue but there isn't.
