# Random Activity API 

Users can refresh the page and see a new activity displayed everytime. This site uses the Bored.com API and displays the data returned from the api.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

The random activites API displays the activities data that is requested.

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

This was an introductorary to using API's and fetching data from them. This was a great way to try a simple API's out! Later on the API stopped working as it did in the beginning so I will be working to update this in the future!
