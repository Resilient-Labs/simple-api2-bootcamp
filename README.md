## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and fetch web API

User is able to type the name of a NBA player and get back the draft selection, college player attended and date of birth. 

## Lessons Learned:

This specific api retuned an object with a property that had four array. Within the arrays there was hundreds of NBA players. In order to retrieve the player the user asked for, I had to loop through all the elements in the four arrays and find a matching element with the first and last name.
