## What

This project makes a request to an external server using a poem API. It's purpose is get the weather!

## How it works
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used the Fetch API and event listener to send requests to an external server. With this function, after the user clicks the button, a poem will be generated to the DOM. I used the appendChild method to show each line. I used CSS to make the simple application more interactive.

## Lessons learned
I learned how to use a loop in conjunction with append child to show each poem's line separately, as opposed to a large block of text.
