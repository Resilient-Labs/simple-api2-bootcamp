# Simple Weather API

## What

This project makes a request to an external server using a weather API. It's purpose is get the weather!

## How it works
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used the Fetch API and event listener to send requests to an external server. With this function, after the user clicks the button, a random quote will be generated in the DOM.

## Lessons learned
Using an API makes programming more efficient! I understand now when they say do not reinvent the wheel. With just 13 lines of code, a simple app can become sophisticated and clean.
